LINUX BOOTING PROCESS:


1)	BIOS/ UEFI – Power on 
•	System wakes up and checks all hardware parts ( Ex: Ram, storage device, keyboard)
•	This process is called Power On Self System (POST)
•	Then its looks for bootable device like pen drive and hard disk.

2)	GRUB (Boot loader)
•	GRUB job is to start the operating system.
•	It shows a menu if you have a multi OS like Windows and linux, We have to choose linux .
•	Then it loads the Linux kernel into memory.

3)	Kernel Loading 
•	The Linux kernel is the heart of the OS.
•	Then it starts working, then it mounts the root file system (/) so system can access the file. 
•	Then it starts the first program its called system.

4)	Systemd (starting services)
•	Systemd starts all the background services needed for the system like network and display.
•	It also mounts other file system and prepares the system for user.

5)	Login Screen 
•	Finally, the system shows the login prompt.
•	Enter the password and user name and the shell(bash  --> .bashrc and .bash_profile or .profile) starts.


DIRECTORS AND ITS PURPOSE:


/  (root)  -  it is the top level directory, a file and directors starts here.
/bin ( bin) – Essential user commands needed for system boot and repair (Ex: ls, cp, mv and cat).
/var (var) - Variable data like logs, spools, and cache (/var/log, /var/tmp).
/etc (etc) – System configuration files and startup scripts (Ex: /etc/passwd, /dev/tty).
/opt (opt) – Optional or third-party software packages (e.g. proprietary apps).
/home (home) – Personal directories for each user.
/tmp (tmp) - Temporary files (cleared after reboot).
/usr (usr) - User system resources, it contains most user applications and libraries (/usr/bin, /usr/lib).
/lib (lib) – Shared library files needed by programs in /bin and /sbin.
/mnt (mnt) - Mount point for temporary mounting of files ystems (manual mounts). 

/boot (boot) – Contains  boot loader files like GRUB, kernel images like vmlinuz  and system.
/dev (dev) – Holds device files ( present hardware devices).
/media (media) - Temporary mount point for removable devices (like USBs, CDs).
/proc (proc) - Virtual directory that provides system and process information (e.g. /proc/cpuinfo).
/root (root) - Home directory for the root (superuser).
/run (run) - Stores runtime data (like PIDs, sockets) created after boot.
/sbin (sbin) - System administration commands (e.g. reboot, fsck, ifconfig).
/srv (srv) - Contains data for services like web or FTP servers.
/sys (sys) - Virtual directory showing kernel and hardware information (device drivers, etc.).
