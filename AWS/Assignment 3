A symbolic link:
 
     1)It doesn't save real data of the file.

     2) It just points to the location of the  file.

     3) When the original file is relocated or deleted, the symlink becomes broken (stripped of meaning).

There are two types:

     1) Soft link (Symbolic link)

     2) Hard link

Soft link: 

     1) Like Windows shortcut.

     2) Refers to the original file location.

     3) Can link directories also.

     4) If original file is deleted → symlink wouldn’t work.

Hard link:
    
     1) Exact mirror of the file.

     2) Refers to same data on disk.

     3) If you delete the original file → hard link STILL works.

     4) Cannot link directories.
