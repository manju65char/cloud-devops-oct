CLOUD SERVICE MODELS

IAAS
PAAS
SAAS 

cloud computing deployment models 


public
private 
hybrid cloud  aws + on premises 


aws -->  default 
VPC --> own network and servers setup and its configuration  ,  Bastion host  or jump server 

              ssh         NAT GATEWAY 
bastionhost ------> app server 

web server  --> httpd or nginx --> html,css,js
app server   
db server 

====================


AWS global infrastructure : 

Region
AZs or availability zones
Edge locations 


Region -->  a region is a geographical location which host 3 or more AZs, each region has min of 3 AZs 


AZ : 

collection of data centers with in a region 




us-east1    -> N.virginia 

us-east1a
us-east1b
us-east1c
us-east1d
us-east1e
us-east1f


us-east-1a       us-east-1b   us-east-1c



ec2->app


us-east1           us-west-2

ec2->app


Mumbai 

ap-south-1


ap-south-1a
ap-south-1b

ap-hyderbad-1b
ap-hyderbad-1c




3. Edgelocation  or cach location or copy replication or CDN --> cloudfront   --> azure frontdoor or cdn profiles 


amazon.com

chennai -------> edge location -----------------Mumbai/HYD -------------------------------------> origin server(ec2,serverless service,s3,ecs,eks) amazon.com (usa  us-east-1 , us-east-1a)




charcoal --> shop1 ---------------------------------------> wholesale shop -------------------------------> manufactory unit 

==================================================


aws free tier :  for 12 months --> pay as you go --> you are going to pay the charges/bills based on usage , like electricity or post paid 

ec2 --> 750 hours per month  --> t2.micro --> instance type 

10 instances 

10*24 = 3 27  


24*30 == 

S3 BUCKET
RDS --> 
efs
storage

Linux is an opensource os, it's for free , it has both text and graphical based os 



merits: 

Opensource : 

source code is freely available , can be modified or distributed 


security : 

robust security features ---> user/files permission and multi user environment 



db_Config.txt  --> John --> read or write or executable(shell script)


John



WSL -> ON WINDOWS --> Windows subsystem Linux --> hypervisor 




stability or reliability : 


1.2 --> 1.2  

2025 --> 1.2              --> 30 


performance 


Pkg management (software package mgt)


WhatsApp --> 

=========

demerits : 

software compatibility 

driver support : 



user interface or desktop env : 


folder -> directory 



limited support for certain softwares : 


===================


Linux distributions or Linux flavours  : 

2 types of Linux distribution families : 

1. Debian family 
2. Fedora family 

1. Debian family     -> apt or apt-get   --> advanced pkg mgt tool 

Debian 
kali
ubuntu 


2.  Fedora family   -> yum 

fedora
redhat Linux
centos 
alma Linux
openSUSE 
amazonlinux 2 amazonlinux 2023 



============================

Linux task : 

1 : the Linux booting process(purpose of each steps in the process) and Linux directory structure , purpose of each directories


=======================================================

/ --> root directory 

root user dir is different --> when you log in as a root user --> default dir 


all other directories are sub or child directories of the root dir . 


/bin : --> system user binaries  -> this dir holds the essential user command binaries or Linux utilities or Linux commands 
ex: ls,cp,mv,yum,apt,bash,rm, ----> reside here 


/etc  : -> system configuration --> control panel on Linux 

  passwd --> user account inform(user name) , group, hosts(to store the DNS entries --> )
  hosts(to store the DNS entries -->DNS resolution,  mapping the dns records --> ip with domain name --> 192.123.2.3 amazon.com
  sudoers -> sudo configuration  (default user would be root ,  )

whenever you are going to create a user ----> it creates a user and a users group 

whenever you are going to create a group ----> it creates a users group only 


guru   -> devops

john  --> john and john group 


you need add john to devops group --> john will get devops access 


/home ---> user home dir  

john 

/home/john 

/var --> variables file   --> logs, mails and so on 


/usr  --> user binaries /usr /usr/lib /usr/share /usr/bin

/usr/bin


git 

git add , git commit git push 

/sbin   -> system command binaries or adm commands,  fdisk, ifconfig , reboot -->  system related troubleshooting 


/opt  --> install the third party applications, SonarQube or tomcat, nexus 

 
/tmp -->  these files will deleted upon reboot 


/proc

/dev -->
